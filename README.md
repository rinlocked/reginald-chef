This is a HackBI IX Project made by Stephen Lebedz, Dean Lorenz, and Xavier Knox.
We used Google Gemini to help us setup the Auth0 connection and link Gemini to our website in app.js
We had a really fun time making this.

Xavier - did all the pictures and design. Stephen helped him bring his ideas into the style.css file.
Dean - helped setup the Auth0.
Stephen - wrote all the HTML and linked the 3 files together.
